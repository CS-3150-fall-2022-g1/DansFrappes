# Sprint 3 Retrospective

SCRUM Master - Reagan

## What went well?
* We were on top of things, productive, and had time to finish things
* Made working systems instead of half-done systems
* Better documentation of tasks and stand-ups
* Better inter-team communication

## What didn't go well?
* Busy, hard to work on the project in the middle of midterms
* A lot of little things we had to cut for time
* Lots of changes made after meeting with Dan

## What can we improve?
* Make sure everyone knows their tasks early on and communicates so documentation goes smoothly

## Team work breakdown
1. Josh - 25%
2. Reagan - 25%
3. Spencer - 25%
4. Jason - 25%

Each of us had time we didn't work on it and time we did more. We each contributed and because of that made a lot of progress this sprint.
