# Unit Testing

The program currently has three unit tests. Each tests a different utility method with various possible inputs.

## Running the unit tests
1. Open a shell in the [DjangoServer](https://github.com/CS-3450-fall-2022-g1/DansFrappes/tree/master/com/DansFrappes/src/DjangoServer) folder
    * Django runs tests based on the CWD. This is important
2. Run the manage.py script with the 'test' argument
  ```
  python manage.py test
  ```
