# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What worked well?
1. We had a great planning meeting at the start of the sprint to divide and plan tasks.
2. When we realized we had an issue, we were able to change direction to benefit the whole team.

## What could be improved?
1. Scrum meetings happened rarely, and we didn't write notes for them. Communication would be easier if we did this more often in the future.
2. We decided that moving forward we will use Jira, since that provides more useful tools to help us be productive.

### What will we commit to next Sprint?
1. We will hold Scrum meetings more often so we know what needs to be done and are more accountable.
    * We will also take notes
2. We will work on making steady progress rather than rushing to make progress at the end.
