Instructions for running server:

1. Open your terminal

You will need to have Django downloaded to your machine. Run this command:

"python -m pip install Django (if on a mac, run python3 instead)"

if you do not have python you will need to download that as well: 

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

2. Next you will need to download our project. I suggest creating a repo from our github: 

"git clone https://github.com/CS-3450-fall-2022-g1/DansFrappes.git"

Then you will cd into our Django Server Directory

"cd .../DansFrappes/com/DansFrappes/src/DjangoServer"

3. From here you can run the following command to have a database:

"python manage.py migrate"

4. Then you can run the server with the following commands

"python manage.py runserver" (again, if on a mac, run python3 instead)

This will open a server display on your terminal with an https link to what
is your local host. Copy that link into your desired browser and go to the link
