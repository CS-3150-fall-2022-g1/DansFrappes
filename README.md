## Configuration
Our system will contain several different webpages that allow for employee hour input, a wage tracker, a payout system controlled by the manager who will also act as an admin for the site. Employees will have special access to be able to take orders, submit hours, and give orders to customers.

Customers will have access to the pages inputs such that they may make orders and customize to their liking. They will have access to future implemented features of the website.

Managers will be the administrators and act as the head honcho over all systems. They can control data flow, pay, and change features and add ins to drinks.

## Implmentation
Using a framework (I believe Django?) we will create a home page, an ordering page, a drink selection and customization page, a checkout page, a page for employees to submit hours, a page for managers to pay employees, and other things to be added.

Potential languages used will be Python, HTML, and Javascript at the very least. Others could be implemented based on the needs of the website. Our database will most likely be in sql. We can keep track of orders, hours, employees, customers, pay, and when empoyees are paid.

## Testing
We can test using a number of platforms (Selenium, TestRail) or we can develop our own tests. We would want to chech order limits, drink customization validity, limits on hours, wages, and check our database for potential errors.

## Maintainance
This website is a growing project and will require constant updates and watch. We will add new features, new drinks, increase pay, keep clean and readable code, efficient and fast response times, and make sure the next people to lead know what is going on.

## For the user
You will be able to navigate between a variety of helpful pages with buttons/quicklinks to browse, buy, and rate our products. You could have dropdown bars for your add ins, and a slider menu to take you wherever you would like to go. There will be numerous ways to return to your checkout and even check how long your order has left to get to you. There may even be options for takeout and delivery. There will be clean, clear images of each drink to help you decide. There will be descriptions of what the base drink is and recommendations based on user reviews.
